### Observer
Observer is a personal project I started in order to improve my understanding of hard real-time embedded systems. 
Additionally, the focus of observer is mainly related to computer vision and TCP/IP networking sockets.

### Vision
Currently, my vision for observer is: the ability to capture video frames on a remote system, 
send the frames over a TCP/IP network to a host machine, store the frames in a RAID 5 disk setup
for additional fault tolerance
