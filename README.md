### Observer
Observer is a personal project I started in order to improve my understanding of hard real-time embedded systems. 
Additionally, the focus of observer is mainly related to computer vision and video frame capturing.

### Vision
Currently, my vision for observer is the ability to capture video frames on a remote system based on a schedule, 
send the frames over a TCP/IP network to a host machine where the frames will be stored in a RAID
5 disk setup in order to provide robust fault tolerance.
